# Class 2 Homework

## Practicing Pseudocode

Sketch out the following algorithms in pseudocode

1. Write the following "story" in pseudocode:
* Replicate the story that you created using pseudocode variables, in Javascript:
* Alex has $100.
* Alex buys a burrito for $8.
* Joe repays Alex the $50 he lended him. Joe has $200 left over.
* Alex pays Molly $20 to babysit his kids.
* Molly sees a movie with Joe, and each pays $10
* Print each person's amount, in the order you created the variables.
* What is the sum of Molly, Alex, and Joe's money? Print the answer.

2. Adding on to exercise 1, print a message stating whether or not Alex can afford a ticket to the Bruce Springsteen concert, if a ticket costs $125.

3. Take two variables, x and y, and write pseudocode to check that x is the larger of the two, swapping their values if y happens to be larger.
4. Write a while loop that prints out every even number between 1 and 50 (inclusive). (One way to do this is to use the [modulus operator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h6zfzfy7(v=vs.90).aspx).)
5. Do the same as exercise 4, using a for loop.
6. Write a loop that prints out all of the odd numbers between 4 and 40.
7. *Challenge problem*: Write an algorithm that prints out the first 50 terms of the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html).

## Getting Started with Javascript

We talked about Javascript (JS) briefly in class, and will spend the rest of our time working with this programming language. These exercises are self-guided, and will get a little bit of early practice with JS.

1. Create an account at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
2. In the [Javascript Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), start the first lesson in Unit 1, completing up through exercise 11.
3. If you finish and want to continue, feel free to work ahead! These exercises are self-guided, and introduce needed concepts as you go.
