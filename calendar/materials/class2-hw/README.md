# Class 2 Homework

## More Javascript basics
* Finish the first lesson in Unit 1 of the [Javascript Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) at Codecademy, "Getting Started With Programming" (i.e. exercises 12-23)
* In Unit 2, complete exercises 1 through 9 in the first lesson, "Introduction to Functions in JS"

For any of these units, feel free to work on all of the exercises, but know that we won't have talked about all of the concepts in class.
