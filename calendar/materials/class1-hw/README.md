# Class 1 Homework

## Getting started with Javascript
Before getting started, make sure you can access Piazza using the link on the left-hand side of the site. We did this during class.

### Sign up for Piazza

Visit the [course signup page](https://piazza.com/launchcode/summer2016/lc101). Enter the access code `lc101` on the enrollment screen. If you don't have a Piazza account, you will be prompted to sign up for one after submitting your course enrollment.

Piazza is a course communication platform that we will use for course announcements, and as a way for students to post questions and solutions online. It is used for all LaunchCode courses.

### Get started with Javascript at Codecademy

1. Create an account at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) (we did this in class).
2. In the [Javascript Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), start the first lesson in Unit 1, completing up through exercise 11.
3. If you finish and want to continue, feel free to work ahead! These exercises are self-guided, and introduce needed concepts as you go.
