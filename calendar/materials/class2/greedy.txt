// class exercise: making change

// we'll assume change is number of total cents, $1.77 is actually 177 cents

// get rid of whole dollars
change = change % 100

// here's another way to get rid of whole dollars
while change >= 100
	change = change - 100
	
// now, change is < 100; get as many quarters as possible
numberOfQuarters = 0
while change >= 25
	numberOfQuarters = numberOfQuarters + 1
	change = change - 25

// now change < 25, get as many dimes as possible
numberOfDimes = 0
while change >= 10
	numberOfDimes = numberOfDimes + 1
	change = change - 10
	
// now change < 10, get as many nickels as possible
numberOfNickels = 0
while change >= 5
	numberOfNickels = numberOfNickels + 1
	change = change - 5
	
// now change < 5
numberOfPennies = change

totalCoins = numberOfQuarters + numberOfDimes + numberOfNickels + numberOfPennies
