// how many quarters? - given a variable called change, print the most number of quarters that I can make using that amount

numberOfQuarters = 0
while change >= 25
	numberOfQuarters = numberOfQuarters + 1

print numberOfQuarters

// Let's look at an example where change = 77

// first loop: 77 >= 25 is true, numberOfQuarters = 1, change = 52
// second loop: 52 >= 25 is true, numberOfQuarters = 2, change = 27
// third loop: 27 >= 25 is true, numberOfQuarters = 3, change = 2
// fourth loop: 2 >= 25 is false
