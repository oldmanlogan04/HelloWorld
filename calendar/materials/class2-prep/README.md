Before coming to [Class 2](../class2), please complete the following tasks:

##### Computational Thinking

Task | Instructions | Link  | 
--------------|-------------|-------------
Watch | Watch part of the first lecture from Harvard's CS50 class, which reviews binary and algorithms. Start at 5:38, and feel free to stop at the 27 minute mark (past that is only CS50-specific details)| <a href="https://youtu.be/zFenJJtAEzE?t=338" target="_blank">CS50, Week 0</a>
Watch | Watch this short from CS50 that explains what an algorithm is, and why this concept is so essential to programming. |  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLczUUHWNw&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Algorithms</a> |

##### Pseudocode

Task | Instructions | Link  | 
--------------|-------------|-------------
Read | Read this article from the Viking Code School about pseudocode. Throughout the article they will reference other parts of their curriculum - don't worry about that (though feel free to check it out if you're interested!). | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/what-is-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">What is Pseudo-Coding?</a>
Read | Continue on to the next section, which talks about the foundational components of pseudocode and code.  | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/the-elements-of-pseudocode" target="_blank">The Elements of Pseudocode</a> | 
Exercise | Try solving some problems by writing out solutions in pseudocode. | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/practice-with-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">Practice with Pseudocoding</a> |  
Exercise | This is a fun exercise you can do to practice your pseudocoding skills, and amuse some family and/or friends. This exercise was taken from a different class, so ignore some of the references to the class. You can also ignore the "Evaluation" or "What to Hand In" parts.  | <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/homework/origami.html" target="_blank">Dinosaur Origami</a>
