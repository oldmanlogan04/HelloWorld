# Class 2 Prep

Before coming to [Class 2](../class2), please complete the following tasks:

##### Computational Thinking

Task | Instructions |
--------------|------------- |
Watch | Watch this short from CS50 that explains what an algorithm is, and why this concept is so essential to programming.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLczUUHWNw&index=1&list=PLhQjrBD2T380dhmG9KMjsOQogweyjEeVQ" target="_blank">Algorithms</a>  
***
##### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a fancy term for writing down code-like instructions using words and structures similar to code, but more readable to humans, and without the specific, strict syntax rules of programming languages. Using pseudocode as the first stage in solving programming problems is a valuable skill to learn early on. It'll let you think about the problem separate from the details of the solution in code.

Task | Instructions |  
--------------|-------------|
Read | Read this article from the Viking Code School about pseudocode. Throughout the article they will reference other parts of their curriculum - don't worry about that (though feel free to check it out if you're interested!). <br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/what-is-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">What is Pseudo-Coding?</a>
Read | Continue on to the next section, which talks about the foundational components of pseudocode and code.<br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/the-elements-of-pseudocode" target="_blank">The Elements of Pseudocode</a> |
Exercise | Try solving some problems by writing out solutions in pseudocode. We'll go over one of these exercises (or one very similar) at the beginning of class 2.<br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/practice-with-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">Practice with Pseudocoding</a>
