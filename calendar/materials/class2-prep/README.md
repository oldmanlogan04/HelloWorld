##### Pseudocode

Task | Instructions |  
--------------|-------------|
Read | Read this article from the Viking Code School about pseudocode. Throughout the article they will reference other parts of their curriculum - don't worry about that (though feel free to check it out if you're interested!).<br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/what-is-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">What is Pseudo-Coding?</a>
Read | Continue on to the next section, which talks about the foundational components of pseudocode and code.<br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/the-elements-of-pseudocode" target="_blank">The Elements of Pseudocode</a> |
Exercise | Try solving some problems by writing out solutions in pseudocode.<br>**Link:** <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/practice-with-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">Practice with Pseudocoding</a>

##### Javascript Basics

Task | Instructions |  
--------------|-------------|
Watch | We're going to introduce you to your first programming language, Javascript. This is one of the primary languages used to build most websites. Indeed, it is so essential to web programming, that most modern browsers allow you to code in the browser. Watch this video to get a brief introduction for how to mess around with Javascript in the browser. This assumes you are using Google Chrome, but most other browsers allow you to do this too. To figure out how to use the console in your internet browser, just Google "mybrowser javascript console", where 'mybrowser' is the name of the browser you have (Firefox, Safari, etc.), and follow instructions you find there.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGdd9qNwQdQ" target="_blank">Javascript Tutorial for Beginners</a>
Watch | Watch the next tutorial that will talk about the if / else conditionals we learned in pseudocode, and how to use them in Javascript.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy87ZS5sb1w" target="_blank">Javascript Tutorial part 2</a>
