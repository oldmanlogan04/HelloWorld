Read / Do Exercise | Try solving some problems by writing out solutions in pseudocode. | <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/software-engineering-basics/practice-with-pseudo-coding" target="_blank">Practice with Pseudocoding</a> |  
Do Exercise | This is a fun exercise you can do to practice your pseudocoding skills, and amuse some family and/or friends.

You can also ignore the "Evaluation" or "What to Hand In" parts.  | <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/homework/origami.html" target="_blank">Dinosaur Origami</a>
