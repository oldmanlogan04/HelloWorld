## Notes

I bungled the binary calculation, switching the order of the two-digit numbers -- I wrote 01 for 2 instead of 10. Sorry about that. CS50 has a great [short video on binary numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacBFrgtQjQ) that I recommend. Again, at this point of our learning, you shouldn't feel like you could calculate any binary number given a decimal number. But you should understand the basic difference between binary and decimal number systems, and how binary numbers play into data representation using bits (i.e. 0s and 1s) within computers.
