# Class 3 Prep

Before coming to [Class 3](../class3), please complete the following tasks:

##### The World Wide Web

Task | Instructions | 
--------------|------------- |
Watch | Watch this video from CS50 that talks about the world of web programming. You don't need to know all of this, but it will allow us to scratch the surface of how the internet works, and how we, as programmers, can interact with it. It will make reference to earlier videos and some other programming concepts, but don't worry about those for now.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS_NAORY2Jw&list=PLhQjrBD2T382PCsb1fFV7aSujdErpyr6M&index=1" target="_blank">Internet Primer</a>

##### Javascript Basics

Task | Instructions |  
--------------|-------------|
Watch | We're going to introduce you to your first programming language, Javascript. This is one of the primary languages used to build most websites. Indeed, it is so essential to web programming, that most modern browsers allow you to code in the browser. Watch this video to get a brief introduction for how to mess around with Javascript in the browser. This assumes you are using Google Chrome, but most other browsers allow you to do this too. To figure out how to use the console in your internet browser, just Google "mybrowser javascript console", where 'mybrowser' is the name of the browser you have (Firefox, Safari, etc.), and follow instructions you find there.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGdd9qNwQdQ" target="_blank">Javascript Tutorial for Beginners</a>
