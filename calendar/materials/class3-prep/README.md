# Class 3 Prep

Before coming to [Class 3](../class3), please complete the following tasks:

##### The World Wide Web

Task | Instructions |
--------------|------------- |
Watch | Watch this video from CS50 that talks about the world of web programming. You don't need to know all of this, but it will allow us to scratch the surface of how the internet works, and how we, as programmers, can interact with it. It will make reference to earlier videos and some other programming concepts, but don't worry about those for now.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS_NAORY2Jw&list=PLhQjrBD2T382PCsb1fFV7aSujdErpyr6M&index=1" target="_blank">Internet Primer</a>

##### Web pages: HTML, CSS and JS

Task | Instructions |
--------------|------------- |
Watch | Watch the first 5 videos from Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS course (don't worry, they're all short). We'll be looking at how Javascript is used within web pages to make them dynamic, and since web pages are built out of HTML and CSS, we'll need a little understanding of how these different tools and languages interact. If you like these videos, keep going! Knowing more is never a bad thing.<br>**Link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cZtdKNB9jo&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPmd5v7c9i883AwqVZquegHM" target="_blank">Intro to HTML and CSS playlist</a>
