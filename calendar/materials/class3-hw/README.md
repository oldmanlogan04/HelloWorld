# Class 3 Homework

## Virtual LED Wall

This will be your first project combining Javascript with HTML and CSS to make webpages dynamic.

Head over to the [Virtual LED Wall project page](https://github.com/chrisbay/virtual-led-wall) and follow the instructions there.

You'll need to download the project files, and work on your computer in an editor. Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Mac) are fine plain text editors that are already installed on your system. You may want to install a basic coded editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), in order to get nice features like syntax highlighting. You should __never__ open code in a formatted editor like Microsoft Word.

Once you've got your files set up, and have poked around a bit, take a stab at at least one of the projects at the bottom of the [project page](https://github.com/chrisbay/virtual-led-wall). To get started, I recommend trying Random or Vertical.

You'll want to use Chrome developer tools, so check out a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9PLPFTnkE&list=PLfdtiltiRHWEQ6wtGVC57qrlRtQPyylya) or two to get more comfortable.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've completed Hello, World!

Your next steps on the road to learning to code are to keep practicing and learning, and get involved in another course or program. LaunchCode will host another CS50x class beginning in fall 2016, and there will likely be summer class options as well. Sign up for the newsletter at the [Mentor Center page](https://www.launchcode.org/mentorcenter) and you'll receive info on all of our programming as it's announced.
