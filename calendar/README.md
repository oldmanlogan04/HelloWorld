#Course Calendar

Before coming to each class, please complete the Prep Work for that class. This will be the way you learn most of the skills in this course, and will make sure you get the most out of coming to class. The "In Class" pages will provide you with all of the resources you'll need during class, along with a transcript of what will be covered (usually posted the morning of each class). Happy learning!

Class # | Date | Before Class | During Class | After Class | Overview
:------:|:----:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------:|------------|
Class 1 | 5/21/16 | Get excited! | [In Class](./materials/class1) | [Homework](./materials/class1-hw/) | This class will start with the most basic question: what is code? As we'll see, this is actually a trickier question to answer than you might expect. We'll introduce you to the world of computer science and coding, and then talk about what it means to think like a computer programmer. We'll also start working with some actual code, introducing you to the Javascript language and look at variables, data types and statements. We'll also talk about problem solving, and breaking down problems into pieces. |
Class 2 | 5/28/16 | [Prep Work](./materials/class2-prep) | [In Class](./materials/class2) | [Homework](./materials/class2-hw/) | With some basic footing underneath us, we'll dive into more complex programming concepts that help programs make decisions: loops and conditionals. We'll also introduce arrays, which are ways to store data. We'll also continue to discuss problem-solving strategies. |
Class 3 | 6/4/16 | [Prep Work](./materials/class3-prep)| [In Class](./materials/class3) | [Homework](./materials/class3-hw/) | Having covered most of the basics of programming (wow, really?!) we'll apply our knowledge to the world of the web, using our basic coding skills to program a virtual LED wall within a web page.
