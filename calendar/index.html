<p>Before coming to each class, please complete the Prep Work for that class. This will be the way you learn most of the skills in this course, and will make sure you get the most out of coming to class. The &quot;In Class&quot; pages will provide you with all of the resources you'll need during class, along with a transcript of what will be covered (usually posted the morning of each class). Happy learning!</p>

<td>This class will start with the most basic question: what is code? As we'll see, this is actually a trickier question to answer than you might expect. We'll introduce you to the world of computer science and coding, and then talk about what it means to think like a computer programmer.</td>

<p>We'll also start working with some actual code, introducing you to the Javascript language and look at data types and statements. |
Class 2 | 5/21/16 | <a href="./materials/class2-prep">Prep Work</a> | <a href="./materials/class2">In Class</a> | <a href="./materials/class2-hw/">Homework</a> | Now that we have a foundation, it's time to start solving some problems. To do that, we'll introduce you to pseudocode, which allows us to think like a coder, without getting bogged down with tricky syntax. In fact, this is a really important skill for programmers of all levels; most of the best coders will write out solutions to their problem in pseudocode before trying to write it in code. Using pseudocode, you will learn some of the most important concepts in programming, such as variables, conditionals, and loops. We'll end by dipping our toes into some actual code, and getting ready to hit the ground running with more code in week 3. |
Class 3 | 6/4/16 | <a href="./materials/class3-prep">Prep Work</a>| <a href="./materials/class3">In Class</a> | <a href="./materials/class3-hw/">Homework</a> | Finally, it's time to get our hands dirty with some real code! We'll transition from pseudocode to an actual programming language - in this case, a language called Javascript. To do that, we'll walk through how the concepts we learned in pseudocode translate to code (turns out, it's not so different!). Applying our new skills, we'll see how we can start to do some interesting things. We'll write our first programs, and show you how you'll be able to use your newfound powers.</p>
