#Hello, World!

Welcome to LaunchCode's Hello, World!, an introduction to the world of coding. No coding experience? No problem! This course will explain what code is, and teach you how to think like a computer programmer. You'll also get the chance to dive in and get your hands dirty writing lines of code using a programming language called Javascript. Before we get started, you may have a few questions.

## What will we do in this class?

Coding is fun, but it can also be intimidating. Many people don't know how to start, or what they should do to learn. We're here to help! This class will provide an accessible introduction to coding, and show you a path to continue learning. We'll do this with:

* **Live Meetups:** We get together physically in real life on regularly scheduled days. This routine will help keep you on track, and give you the opportunity to learn collaboratively with other students.

* **Mentored Support:** Receive help from an expert instructor and a team of genius, good-looking LaunchCode mentors.

* **Curated Content:** We have compiled and ordered learning resources into a step-by-step guide to help you learn and digest the concepts and skills you will learn in this course. 

* **Additional Exercises:** Weâ€™ve also developed our own additional exercises and activities that will provide plenty of practice to the skills you learn.

## What will I learn in this class?
* What coding is, and how it works
* How to think like a computer program, and use algorithms to solve problems efficiently
* The powers of pseudocode, and how to think through coding problems
* The basics of a programming language called Javascript, and how to use it to write some cool programs

## What's next?

Come to the first class! We'll walk you through how to understand the rest of the curriculum. 

When you're ready, you can look at the course calendar.
